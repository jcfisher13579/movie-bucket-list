# Bucket List Movies


## Description

This application was created by our group to finally satisfy that annoying habit of watching a movie, and having nowhere to really voice your opinion. Now not only are you allowed to voice your opinion on a movie without being scrutinized, but you can also do it on your very own 2014 imDb top 50 movie bucket list. This application helps you keep track of what movies you have already watched and reviewed as you make your way through the top 50.

## Installation 

N/A

## Usage 

When you first load the application, you will be met with a login or signup screen.

After loggin in or signing up, you will be brought to the homepage, where the top 50 movies are then listed.

``` 

When clicking on a movie that you wish to leave a review on, you are redirected to a new page that provides a form to review the movie.
